in this project we learn about authentication and authorization 

 - DJango comes with a user authentication system it handles user account growth permissions and cookie based user session

 - Django authentication provide birth authentication and authorization together and is generally referred to as a authentication system


 By default the required configuration is already included in setting dot BY generated by the Django admin start project these consist of 2 item lists in your INSTALL_APPS setting

- django.contrib.auth  = contain core authentication framework and its default models .
-  django.contrib.contentypes  = is the django content type sysytem , which allow permissions to be associated with models you create . 

SessionMiddleware manage sessions across request . 
authenticationMiddelware associated user with request using session . 




Authentication =  Authentication is about validating your credentials like username and the password to verify your identity so then furthure use are services . if they have autheticated .

authorization = Authorization is the process of determining whether the authenticate user has access to the particular resources it checks your right to grant you access to resources such as information database file etc

user object - user object are the core of the authenticate system

-the typically representation the people interacting with your site and are used to enable things like restricting access registering user profile associating content with creator etc

-Only one class of user exist in Django authentication framework super user or admin staff user are just user object with special attributes said not different classes of user objects


what we see in this framework . 

- create superuser 
- changing password 
- authentication user 
- createuser 
- permissions and authorization
- groups 
- how to log a user in 
- how to log a user out 



first we see this things from ui mean admin pannels . 

we have three user root - root , _ritiksharmaaa - Ritik###0981 , ritiksharmaaa - ritik###0981 ,
this is see which user have permissions have or not only prefencer user can do something in admin .


if you give user to permission to add user so you have also give the permission ro change in autho than it works 


if you want to use password in front end you have give render_value = true in widget .
