# Start cashier if another is not specified in your setting file the cache is per process and thread saves.

Each process will have its own private case instance which means no cross - process caching is possible this obviously also means the local memory case is not particularly memory - efficient.

It probably not good choice for production environment if it nice for development

SETTING FILE SETTING 


CACHES = {
    'default' : {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.LocMemCache',
        LOCATIONS : 'unique-snowflake' # this cache Location is used to identify individual memeory stores . but you can findit . 
            }
